## Image classification steps

This project contains the necessary code and images to understand the image classification process. All images are in the image folder, see below for the order of the files. Each individual file contains code and instructions for using the fie.

### Project files in order are as follows:
* Images as Numerical Data (Images as a grid of pixels)
* Visualising RGB channel (RGB colourspace)
* Pre-processing Examples (Cropping and resizing)
* Green Screen car (Colour Masking, Green screen)
* Colour Conversions (HSV colour conversion) (Work in progress)
* Visualising the data (Day and night image classifier)
